## MAPP

**Application control and presentation layers** are provided as ES6 javscript libraries. **MAPP** utilizes the Openlayers map engine for mapviews and provides an interface to the XYZ API. The library abstracts away the complexities of handling spatial data objects such as layers and locations.

**MAPP.UI** contains utilities to build engaging user interfaces around mapviews. The application views can be dashboards made up of multiple data views such as maps, tables, lists, or graphs.
