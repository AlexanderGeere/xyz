# Database Connection Management Enhancement

## Overview

This PR implements robust database connection handling with retry logic, better error management, and connection pooling optimizations for our PostgreSQL connections.

## Key Changes

1. Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Enhanced connection pool configuration
3. Added comprehensive error handling
4. Improved resource management
5. Added detailed logging
6. Added JSDoc documentation

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Retry Logic

- Maximum of 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff delay between retries
- Initial delay of 1 second, doubling with each retry
- Retries only on specific, recoverable errors:
  - ECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer)
  - ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)
  - 57P01 (Admin shutdown)
  - 57P02 (Crash shutdown)
  - 57P03 (Cannot connect now)
  - Unexpected connection termination

### 2. Connection Pool Configuration

```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env[key],
  keepAlive: true,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000,    // 5 second timeout for connection attempts
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,         // 30 second timeout for idle connections
  max: 20                           // Maximum pool size
});
```

### 3. Error Handling

- Pool-level error handler for idle client issues
- Per-query error handling with retry information
- Proper error classification for retry decisions
- Error logging with context information

### 4. Resource Management

- Guaranteed client release using finally block
- Force release flag for error cases
- Statement timeout handling

### 5. Logging Enhancements

- Query context in error logs
- Retry attempt counting
- Pool identification
- Error details and stack traces

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Example database query with retry logic
const results = await dbs.YOUR_DB(
  'SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1',
  [123],
  5000  // Optional timeout in milliseconds
);
```

## Testing

- Unit tests should be updated to include:
  - Retry behavior verification
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Connection timeout scenarios
  - Pool management

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact on successful queries
- Improved handling of transient failures
- Better resource utilization through connection pooling
- Controlled retry behavior prevents cascade failures

## Documentation

JSDoc documentation has been added.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify retry behavior with simulated network failures
- [ ] Test connection pool limits
- [ ] Verify error logging format
- [ ] Test statement timeout functionality
- [ ] Verify resource cleanup
- [ ] Load test under high concurrency
- [ ] Test with different database configurations

## Security Considerations

- No new security implications
- Maintains existing connection string security
- No exposure of sensitive information in logs
